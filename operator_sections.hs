-- Operators can be called as functions if they are wrapped in parenthesis
-- e.g instead of ding 1 + 2, you can do (+) 1 2, what will treat the op as fucntion

-- Operator Sections can create usefull funcions automatically
-- e.g doubleNum
doubleNum :: Int -> Int
doubleNum = (*2) -- This would be the same as saying 3 * 2 = 6
		 -- So Operator section is about treating operators as functions to build new logic
